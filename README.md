🪨 Stones Selling on a Quarry – Web Application

📌 Project Overview
This project is a web application for a stone quarry business. It helps users view available stones, submit orders, and track recent transactions. The app uses localStorage to persist order data between pages and sessions.

🚀 Features
- View different stone products offered by the quarry
- Submit stone orders via a responsive form
- Data is stored using JavaScript localStorage
- Orders are visible across all pages
- Fully responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries

🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5 (Semantic elements: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Responsive design)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, form validation, localStorage)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)

📂 Pages Included
- index.html – Home page displaying available stone types
- about.html – Company background and list of previous orders
- order.html – Order form to place a new stone order

✅ How to Use
1. Open index.html to view stone products.
2. Navigate to order.html to place an order.
3. All orders will appear in both the home and about pages using localStorage.

⚠️ Known Issues
- No server-side database (only localStorage is used)
- No order editing or deletion yet

🧠 Future Improvements
- Add backend support (e.g., Firebase or Node.js)
- Implement user authentication and admin order dashboard
